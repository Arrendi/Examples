    "Or we could look at the Laplace noise to the counts before they are returned (the method used in differential privacy). We want to see P[count(S1) + NoiseA > count(S0) + NoiseB ] - P[count(S0) + NoiseA > count(S0) + NoiseB ] (very roughly how much leaking is going on).  This simplifies to P[1 + NoiseA > Noise B] - P[NoiseA > NoiseB]. Or if z = P[NoiseA==NoiseB]: ( (1-z)/2 + z ) - ((1-z)/2) = z.  For the Laplace distribution with mean zero and variance 2 b^2 we have z = (1/(4 b^2)) sum_{x=-inf}^{+inf} e^(-x^2/b) (the sum of the PDF squared).  We want a b such that this is equal to epsilon.  And then variance is 2*b^2 / n^2 (after scaling by 1/n to convert counts to factions).  From the normal distribution we know sum_{x=-inf}^{+inf} e^(-x^2/b) is approximately sqrt(pi b).  So z ~ (1/(4 b^2)) sqrt(pi b) ~ epsilon.  So b ~ (pi / (16 epsilon^2))^(1/3).  Or variance = (pi/16)^(2/3) epsilon^(-4/3) n^(-2). "
